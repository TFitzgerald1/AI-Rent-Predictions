# AI-Rent-Predictions
A repository of the work done for my Deep Learning class's final project.

# Dataset
Originally, I was going to use a dataset from the Research & Analytics Group at the Atlanta Regional Commission using information published by the US Census Bureau. This did not work due to the Research & Analytics Group only posting complete data for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.

I was advised by my profressor to use a different dataset, one encapsulating a larger timespan. After researching and consulting my professor, this project utilized a dataset collected from RentData.org. This website is an
independent organization that is not affiliated with any governmental agency. This
website produces interactive maps and rent market analysis for public use based on the
Fair Market Rent rate published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
This project consisted of creating and testing a multi-layered perceptron and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. 

These models were used to predict future rent prices based on the reported averages per county.
